## YAP (Yet Another Pastebin)

This is a small and undocumented project I started about two hours ago. I 
needed a simple and fast PHP-based pastebin, and I wasn't in the right mood for 
searching the web. So I started my very own, which is great, since I already 
am a bgi fan of  Twitter Bootstrap (who helps us, the awkward UI designers, 
live a decent life).

As you may see, this is *very* rough ATM. It just saves and loads the notes 
you take, and it doesn't generate IDs yet. I said *yet*. But it throws an error 
on invalid ID, it has a structure, some scalability ideas and so on, the rest 
is child's play :-)


Requirements I plan to enforce in order to use it:

* PHP 5.3+ (for the server hosting it)
* Any web server able to deal with .htaccess files (yes, even IIS, if tuned accordingly)
* Any modern web 2.0 browser (no, IE, you're still in the Stone Age, so stay away)
* Javascript support is optional, but it may look like real crap if not present

So here's the README file. Will update on next push :-)
